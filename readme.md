# Drive Notepad

A webapp for editing text files in Google Drive, implemented entirely on the client-side.  Running [live on github](https://d1manson.github.io/drivenotepad/app.build.html).

### Development

If, for some reason, you decide to fork this and try and make it work you will need to register various things in the Google Developer Dashboard.   [TODO: document that.] 
Other than that, the only thing you need is [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/), you can then build with the command `npm run build`.
